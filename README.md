## Analysis Summary
The EDA covers various aspects of the dataset, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Below are the key analyses performed:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Converted `Transaction Date` to date format.

### 2. Sales Distribution
- Visualized the distribution of revenue, highlighting the skewed nature of sales data with a long tail of high-value transactions.

### 3. Temporal Analysis
- Examined monthly revenue trends, identifying consistent growth from March to June and a notable dip in February.
- Analyzed daily sales in February to pinpoint specific days with lower or higher sales.

### 4. Store Performance
- Compared the number of transactions across different store locations, showing relatively even distribution with Hell's Kitchen slightly leading.

### 5. Product Popularity
- Identified the most popular product categories and types based on the number of transactions.
- Coffee and tea emerged as the most popular categories, with brewed chai tea and gourmet brewed coffee being the top product types.

### 6. Business Insights
- Suggested strategies for inventory management, promotional efforts, and product development based on the findings.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings:
- Distribution of revenue.
- Monthly revenue trends.
- Daily sales in February.
- Number of transactions per store location.
- Popular product categories and types.
